## Soplang 2.0

It is Almost Here — A Somali-first Programming Language Nears Major Release.
{/* truncate */}
The programming language landscape is about to welcome a fresh and culturally grounded addition: Soplang, a Somali-first programming language, is preparing to launch its long-awaited 2.0 release. Designed with native Somali syntax, dual typing, and full developer tooling, Soplang 2.0 is shaping up to be more than just a language — it's an ecosystem.

Initially released as a minimalist interpreted language, Soplang has evolved into a feature-rich environment intended to make software development more accessible to Somali-speaking developers.

## What's Soplang?

Soplang is a general-purpose programming language built around Somali linguistic conventions. Its core syntax reflects Somali words — like door for variable declarations, haddii for conditionals, and hawl for functions — making it more intuitive for native speakers.

Beyond the syntax, Soplang includes many of the features developers expect from a modern language: object-oriented programming, static typing, module support, and error handling.

## Soplang 2.0: What's New?

The upcoming 2.0 release is a full revamp that significantly expands language capabilities and introduces powerful development tools.

## Language Improvements

**Dual Typing System:** Support for both static and dynamic typing.

**Class System:** OOP via fasalka, inheritance with ka_dhaxal.

**Structured Control Flow:** Including haddii, celi, iska_joog, and loop constructs.

**Error Handling:** With isku_day/qabo (try/catch) semantics
Soplang's syntax is backed by a formal EBNF grammar, implemented fully in the interpreter.

## Expanded Standard Library

Soplang 2.0 ships with a more complete standard library:

**Math Module:** Functions for matrix operations, vectors, and basic statistics.

**File I/O:** Somali-named file handlers like faylka_fur, faylka_qor, and faylka_xir.

**Networking:** Basic HTTP functionality using shabakad_codso and shabakad_jawaab.

**Date/Time:** Native date manipulation in Somali syntax.

The goal is to keep everything practical while preserving linguistic clarity and accessibility.

## Website & Docs

The official website is now live at soplang.org. You'll find full documentation, language reference, community
links, and project updates — all aligned with the language's mission to be educational,
accessible, and community-driven. <Link to="/docs/intro" className="font-bold italic mx-auto w-fit">More About Docs</Link>

## What's Next?

The current focus is on finalizing the Python-based interpreter and testing the tooling across platforms. A Rust-based compiler is on the roadmap for future versions, bringing faster performance and system-level capabilities.

According to the team, the 2.0 beta release is expected within the next 4–6 weeks.

## Why It Matters

Soplang is part of a growing trend toward culturally contextual programming languages. For Somali-speaking learners and developers, this offers an easier entry point into coding — no translation required. For educators, it's a new tool to make computer science more accessible.
And for the wider tech community.
