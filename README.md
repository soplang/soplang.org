# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) must be installed. You can install Bun by running:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
  ```

## Installation

```bash
bun install
```

## Local Development

```bash
bun  start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
bun  build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
