Welcome to the world of Soplang! In this tutorial, we will write your very first program.

## The classic "Hello World"

In Soplang, we say "Kaalay Dunida".

```sop
qor("Kaalay Dunida");
```

## Variables

Variables are declared using `kaydi`:

```sop
kaydi magaca = "Soplang";
qor("Kusoo dhawow " + magaca);
```
