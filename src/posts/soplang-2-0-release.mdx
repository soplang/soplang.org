We are thrilled to announce that **Soplang 2.0** is just around the corner! This release marks a significant milestone in our journey to democratize programming for Somali speakers.

## What is Soplang?

Soplang (Somali Programming Language) is designed to make coding accessible, intuitive, and culturally relevant. By using native Somali syntax, we remove the language barrier that often hinders aspiring developers in the region.

## Key Features in 2.0

### 1. Enhanced Standard Library
We've rewritten core modules to be faster and more robust. File handling, networking, and math operations are now more intuitive than ever.

### 2. New CLI Tool
The new `sop` CLI makes managing projects a breeze.
```bash
sop cusub my-project
sop orod main.sop
```

### 3. Improved VS Code Extension
Enjoy smarter autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and inline documentation in Somali.

## Why This Matters

Programming is a language of power in the modern world. By localizing it, we empower a new generation of creators, problem solvers, and innovators who can build solutions for their own communities.

Stay tuned for the official launch!
