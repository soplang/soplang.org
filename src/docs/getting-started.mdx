Welcome to Soplang! This guide will help you install Soplang, set up your development environment, and write your first Soplang program.

## 1. Installation

Before you can start programming with Soplang, you need to install it on your system. Choose the installation method that works best for you:

### Option 1: Direct Download

**soplang-installer**
```bash
soplang --install
```
*Welcome to the Soplang installer. Please select your operating system...*

### Option 2: Package Managers

**package-manager-install**
```bash
soplang --package-manager
```
*Choose your preferred package manager to install Soplang...*

For more detailed installation instructions, check out our [comprehensive installation guide](/docs/installation).

## 2. Your First Soplang Program

Now that you have Soplang installed, let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program:

**hello.sop**
```soplang
// This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

// Variables
name = "Soplang"
version = 1.2
print(f"Welcome to {name} version {version}!")

// Simple function
def greet(person):
    return f"Hello, {person}!"

message = greet("Developer")
print(message)
```

Save this code in a file named `hello.sop`.

### Running Your Program

To run your Soplang program, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then run:

```bash
soplang hello.sop
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Hello, World!
Welcome to Soplang version 1.2!
Hello, Developer!
```

Congratulations! You've just written and executed your first Soplang program.

## 3. Basic Concepts

### Variables and Data Types

Soplang is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types. The language supports common data types like strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries.

**data_types.sop**
```soplang
// String
name = "Soplang"

// Integer
version = 1

// Float
pi = 3.14159

// Boolean
is_awesome = True

// List
languages = ["Somali", "JavaScript", "Soplang"]

// Dictionary
features = {
    "syntax": "clean",
    "learning_curve": "gentle",
    "performance": "excellent"
}
```

### Control Flow

Soplang uses indentation to define code blocks in control structures:

**control_flow.sop**
```soplang
// If-else statement
age = 25
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor")
elif age >= 18 and age < 65:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a senior")

// For loop
for language in ["Somali", "JavaScript", "Soplang"]:
    print(f"I like {language}")

// While loop
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
print("Blast off!")
```

### Functions

Functions in Soplang are defined using the `def` keyword:

**functions.sop**
```soplang
//Simple function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

// Function with default parameter
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

// Function with type hints (optional)
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```
