This guide shows two easy ways to get started with **Soplang**: downloading a prebuilt release or using the official Docker image.

## General Download (All Platforms)

1. **Download:** Grab the latest release for your platform from the [downloads page](/downloads).
2. **Extract / Install:** Unzip or install the package as provided by the release. If it’s a single binary, place it somewhere in your PATH (e.g., `~/bin` on UNIX-like systems).
3. **(Optional) Add to PATH:** Ensure the `soplang` binary is available on your PATH. For example (shell/zsh):
    ```shell
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.shellrc && source ~/.shellrc
    ```
4. **Verify:** Open your terminal and run:
    ```shell
    soplang --version
    ```

### Run Your First Program

**hello.sop**
```soplang
qor("Hello, World!")
```

Execute the file:
```soplang
soplang hello.sop
```

## Use Docker (No Local Install)

If you already have Docker, you can run Soplang without installing anything else.

### 1) Pull the Image
```shell
docker pull soplang/soplang:latest
```

### 2) Run an Interactive Session
```shell
docker run -it --rm soplang/soplang
```

### 3) Run a Local File
Mount your project directory and execute a file:

```shell
# from your project directory
docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app soplang/soplang soplang hello.sop
```

## Checksums & Offline Install

*   **Verify downloads:** Compare the file’s checksum with the one on the [downloads page](/downloads).
*   **Offline:** Keep the extracted folder/binary and run directly—no internet required after download.

## Troubleshooting

### “command not found”
Make sure `soplang` is on your PATH, or run it via Docker as shown above.

### Permission denied (UNIX-like)
If you downloaded a binary, grant execute permissions:
```shell
chmod +x /path/to/soplang
```

### Still stuck?
Check the [downloads](/downloads) page notes or ask in [community support](/community).
