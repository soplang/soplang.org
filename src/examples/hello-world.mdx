# Hello World

The classic "Hello, World!" program is the traditional first step in learning any programming language.

## The Code

```soplang
qor("Hello, World!")
```

## Explanation

1.  `qor`: This is the built-in function for printing output to the console (equivalent to `print` in Python or `console.log` in JavaScript).
2.  `"Hello, World!"`: This is a string literal.
